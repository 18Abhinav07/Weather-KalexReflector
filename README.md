# KALE Weather Farming System

**Weather-influenced farming protocol for the KALE ecosystem**

This project implements weather-based reward modifiers for KALE token farming through a 15-DAO consensus mechanism. Farm yields are influenced by autonomous market analysis DAOs that determine weather outcomes based on real-time Stellar ecosystem data.

## Overview

Weather outcomes are influenced rather than predicted. The system implements a multi-layered consensus where 15 specialized DAOs analyze market data and vote on binary weather outcomes (GOOD/BAD). These outcomes modify farming rewards:

- **GOOD weather**: Dynamic multiplier  
- **BAD weather**: Dynamic reward penalty

## Architecture

### 10-Block Weather Cycles

The system operates on structured 10-block cycles with distinct phases:

```
Blocks 0-6: Planting Phase
├─ Users can stake KALE tokens (plant) or store safely
├─ Weather wagers can be placed on predicted DAO consensus
└─ Live DAO sentiment analysis available

Blocks 7-8: Agriculture only Phase  
├─ Only Agriculture is allowed
├─ weather wagers Closed
└─ Real-world location reveal 

Block 9: Revealing Phase
├─ Weather consensus calculated via weighted voting
└─ Historical accuracy bonuses applied

Block 10+: Settlement Phase
|- weather Announced
├─ Weather modifiers applied to base farming rewards
├─ Wager payouts distributed
└─ Next cycle preparation
```

### DAO Consensus Engine

Fifteen autonomous DAOs analyze different aspects of Stellar ecosystem health:

**Market Analysis DAOs:**
- Crypto Momentum (BTC/ETH/XLM price action)  
- KALE Performance (KALE/USDC trending)
- XLM Dominance (XLM vs other majors)
- Mean Reversion (overbought/oversold analysis)
- Volatility Clustering (risk assessment)

**Ecosystem Health DAOs:**
- Stellar DEX Health (trading volume, liquidity)
- AQUA Network (protocol participation metrics)
- Liquidity Premium (spread analysis)
- Stablecoin Peg (USDC/EURC stability)

**Technical Analysis DAOs:**
- Multi-Timeframe Analysis (cross-timeframe confirmation)
- Volume-Price Analysis (institutional flow detection)
- Correlation Breakdown (intermarket analysis)

**Additional Specialized DAOs:**
- Flight to Safety (risk-off sentiment)
- Regional Tokens (geographic performance)
- Custom Philosophy (adaptive strategy)

Each DAO's vote is weighted by historical accuracy using exponential performance scaling. Consensus uses blockchain entropy for tie-breaking when votes are split.

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Architecture

**Microservices Design:**
- **Cycle Block Monitor**: Real-time Stellar blockchain monitoring with phase state management
- **DAO Consensus Engine**: Weighted voting calculation with historical performance tracking  
- **Farming Automation Engine**: Plant-work-harvest automation via KALE contracts
- **Weather Integration Service**: DAO consensus to reward modifier bridge
- **Custodial Security Layer**: AES-256 wallet encryption with scrypt key derivation

**Database Schema:**
- PostgreSQL with optimized indexing for cycle operations
- Materialized views for analytics
- Audit trails for all user actions and system events
- JSONB storage for DAO voting data

**API Layer:**
- RESTful endpoints with error handling
- Rate limiting (100 requests/15min) and security headers
- Real-time cycle status polling for CLI integration
- Live feed for phase notifications

### Security Implementation

**Custodial Wallet Management:**
```typescript
// AES-256-GCM encryption with scrypt key derivation
const encryptedWallet = await encrypt(
  privateKey,
  scrypt(password + salt, {N: 16384, r: 8, p: 1}),
  {algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm', authTagLength: 16}
);
```

Zero-trust principles with defense-in-depth security controls. Private keys encrypted at rest, memory-safe decryption with automatic cleanup, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Performance Characteristics

**System Metrics:**
- API response time: P95 < 200ms
- Block processing latency: < 2 seconds  
- DAO consensus calculation: < 1 second for all 15 DAOs
- Database query performance: Complex queries < 50ms
- Memory footprint: < 512MB per microservice instance

**Scalability:**
- Horizontal scaling via stateless service design
- Redis caching layer for high-frequency data
- Database connection pooling with prepared statements
- Event-driven architecture for loose service coupling

## API Reference

### Cycle Management
```bash
GET /api/cycles/current
# Returns current cycle phase, DAO sentiment, available actions

POST /api/cycles/action  
# Submit user action (agriculture/wager/stay) for current block
{
  "userId": "uuid",
  "actionType": "agriculture|wager|stay", 
  "actionData": {"agricultureType": "plant", "stakeAmount": "1000"}
}

GET /api/cycles/live-feed
# Real-time cycle status for CLI polling
```

### Weather & DAO System
```bash
GET /api/weather/statistics
# Historical weather outcomes and accuracy metrics

GET /api/dao/performance  
# Individual DAO historical accuracy and vote patterns

GET /api/weather/cycles?limit=20
